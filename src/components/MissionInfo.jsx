        <span>Nearly 325,000 people are food insecure</span> in the Philadelphia
        Area today. At PlatePals, our mission is to bridge the gap between food
        kitchens in need and compassionate individuals eager to make a
        difference. We believe that everyone deserves access to a warm,
        nourishing meal, and we recognize the power of volunteers in creating
        positive change.
      </p>

      <p className="text-center mt-2 md:mt-6 md:text-xl">
        Our platform serves as a dynamic hub, effortlessly connecting food
        kitchens seeking volunteers with individuals eager to lend a helping
        hand. Developed by students at the Drexel Digital Development Camp.
